### **Title**  
**"Fake News Detection: A Logistic Regression Approach with NLP Techniques"**

---

### **Description**  
This project focuses on detecting fake news using a Logistic Regression model coupled with powerful NLP techniques. The system processes textual data with NLTK's stopword removal, Porter Stemmer for text normalization, and TF-IDF vectorization for feature extraction. Achieving high accuracy and precision, this solution provides a reliable approach to combating misinformation.  

Key highlights include:  
- **Text Preprocessing**: Includes stopword removal, stemming, and normalization using NLTK's Porter Stemmer.  
- **Feature Extraction**: Utilizes **TF-IDF Vectorizer** to convert text into numerical features for model input.  
- **Classification Model**: Logistic Regression model ensures efficient and interpretable predictions.  
- **Performance Metrics**: Demonstrates high accuracy, recall, and F1-Score, ensuring robust fake news detection.  

This system is a comprehensive, data-driven solution designed to help mitigate the spread of fake news effectively.
